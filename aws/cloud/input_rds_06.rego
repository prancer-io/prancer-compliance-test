    "Policy Description": "When Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) supports a new version of a database engine, you can upgrade your DB instances to the new version. There are two kinds of upgrades: major version upgrades and minor version upgrades. Minor upgrades helps maintain a secure and stable RDS with minimal impact on the application. For this reason, we recommend that your automatic minor upgrade is enabled. Minor version upgrades only occur automatically if a minor upgrade replaces an unsafe version, such as a minor upgrade that contains bug fixes for a previous version.",

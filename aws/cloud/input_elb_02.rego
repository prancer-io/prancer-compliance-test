    "Policy Description": "This policy identifies Classic Elastic Load Balancers which have connection draining disabled. Connection Draining feature ensures that a Classic load balancer stops sending requests to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy, while keeping the existing connections open. This enables the load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy.",

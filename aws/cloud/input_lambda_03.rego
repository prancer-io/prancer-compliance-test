    "Policy Description": "TracingConfig is a property of the AWS::Lambda::Function resource that configures tracing settings for your AWS Lambda (Lambda) function. When enabled, AWS Lambda tracing acitivates AWS X-Ray service that collects information on requests that a specific function performed. It reduces the time and effort for debugging and diagnosing the errors._x005F_x000D_ _x005F_x000D_ The value can be either PassThrough or Active. If PassThrough, Lambda will only trace the request from an upstream service if it contains a tracing header with 'sampled=1'. If Active, Lambda will respect any tracing header it receives from an upstream service. If no tracing header is received, Lambda will call X-Ray for a tracing decision.",

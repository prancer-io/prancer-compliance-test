By doing so, you can grant read-only access to these resources without sharing your account key, and without requiring a shared access signature._x005F_x000D_ _x005F_x000D_ This policy identifies blob containers within an Azure storage account that allow anonymous/public access ('CONTAINER' or 'BLOB'). As a best practice, do not allow anonymous/public access to blob containers unless you have a very good reason. Instead, you should consider using a shared access signature token for providing controlled and time-limited access to blob containers.",

Starting February 2017, SSE is enabled by default for all managed disks. ADE is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control, manage, and audit the disk encryption keys and secrets._x005F_x000D_ _x005F_x000D_ This policy detects Virtual Machine (VM) OS disks that are not encrypted at rest using ADE.

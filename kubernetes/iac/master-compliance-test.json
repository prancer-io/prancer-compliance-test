Network policies are implemented by the network plugin, so you must be using a networking solution which supports NetworkPolicy - simply creating the resource without a controller to implement it will have no effect. Kubernetes' Network Policies make it much more difficult for attackers to move laterally within your cluster. You can also use the Kubernetes Network Policy API to create Pod-level firewall rules. These firewall rules determine which Pods and services can access one another inside your cluster. You can find an example of NetworkPolicy : https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#the-networkpolicy-resource For more information on NetworkPolicy, please refer : https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.16/#networkpolicy-v1-networking-k8s-io",

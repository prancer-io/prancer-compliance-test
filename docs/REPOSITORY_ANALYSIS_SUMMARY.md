### Rule Examples and Patterns

#### AWS S3 Security Rule Example
```rego
# PR-AWS-CFR-S3-001: S3 Access Logging
aws_issue["s3_accesslog"] {
    resource := input.Resources[i]
    lower(resource.Type) == "aws::s3::bucket"
    not resource.Properties.LoggingConfiguration.DestinationBucketName
}
```

```rego
# PR-AZR-CLD-KV-002: Key Vault Soft Delete
azure_issue["enableSoftDelete"] {
    lower(input.kind) == "keyvault"
    not input.properties.enableSoftDelete
}
```
